Console Web Browser (CWB) is the successor of my abandoned project AWB(Ascii Web Browser)

You can modify CWB and share your versions of it as long as they do not contain any malicious or harmful code and/or require people to pay money, time, or etc... to use, download, view, or etc.. your modified version of CWB.
